gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.tables 0.60.0 resolves minor bugs in the 0.59.0 release

## Bug fixes

- [#6 .classpath variants](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.tables/issues/6)

    - Removed all development-related natures from the Eclipse `.project` file since this project
      is intended to be configured using SBT and developed using IntelliJ IDEA.
      However, it is necessary to import this project in Eclipse to run the OML development generators
      in Eclipse that generate most of the Scala code for this project.
      
- [#7 Generate the Module.moduleEdges Scala resolver API](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.tables/issues/7)

    - Ran from [oml.tycho #5602af4](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.tycho/commit/5602af46174ec16c58c9c556bb518063bb4a2cc9)
